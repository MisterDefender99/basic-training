Learning HTML and CSS?
 
Let’s do an assignment.
 
To learn things practically, It is always a good way to create something which we can relate to the real world. All that designing frontend requires is creativity. And that’s what we are going to do.
 
**We are going to create a single HTML page where:**
	* An end-user can add a todo item.
	* See the list of todos.
	* Update the status of a todo item.
	* Remove an item from the list
 
**To achieve this, you need to take care of:**
	* Proper input field types in your form
	* Validations
	* Your form fields are cleared once an item is added.
	* Removing item updates the page, and the item is no longer visible
